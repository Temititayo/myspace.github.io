    <h1>Welcome to My Academic and Professional Website</h1>
    <p>I'm a lecturer in Peace and Conflict Studies with interests in data, technology, and traditional conflict resolution, 
		as well as a chartered mediator, security and development practitioner, and a student of climate impact.</p>
	<p>I explore the use of computational and quantitative methods in social science, particularly in conflict and development studies.
		I also explore the use of agent-based modeling, artificial societies and machine learning for policy transformation and 
		fieldwork in the Global South.</p>
	<p>Part of my interests include engineered multi-layered system integrating calibrated historical data, 
		causal dynamics, and even geodesic curvature analogies with implications for time-like structures, 
			as well as the use of differential equations, geodesic paths, and sensitivity analysis to model resentment 
				and conflict intensity. I am also interested in using closed timelike curves (CTCs) as proxies 
					for intractable conflict cycles.</p>
	<p>Welcome to my multi-layered and transdisciplinary world for understanding the role of computational technology in the development of complex social systems!</p>
